AoC 2021
========

This is my first time doing the Advent of Code.
Since I'm trying to keep up with the problems over the month of December,
I'm using Python since it's the language I'm most familiar with.

Note: I'm generally working toward getting the problem solved in the least
amount of coding time,
and generally am not going to go back and clean up the code.
